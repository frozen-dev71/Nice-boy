= Projement back-end

The back-end consists of a Docker container with _Python 3.8_ and _Django 2.2_.

All Python package requirements are listed in
link:../requirements.txt[`requirements.txt`]. The initial requirements include:

* https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/[Django] as the base framework
* http://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[django-crispy-forms]
 for easier form layouts for server-rendered forms
* http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/siteindex.html[markdown] for rendering
 markdown in HTML
* https://www.django-rest-framework.org/[djangorestframework] for creating the
 API for the front-end to consume
* https://docs.pytest.org[pytest] for writing tests
* https://github.com/psf/black[black] for linting and automatically formatting
 the code
* https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[Django Debug
 Toolbar] to
 help with debugging

If you'd like to install additional dependencies, add them to the
link:../requirements.txt[`requirements.txt`] file and rebuild the Docker containers
with `make build`.

The application uses the _SQLite_ database back-end by default.

== Apps

There are two Django `apps` in this application:

* link:auth[`auth`] app - Authentication concerns like logging the user in through
 the login form.
* link:projects[`projects`] app - The core business logic of the application â€“
 keeping track of time spent on projects. Exposes a REST API that can be
 consumed by the front-end. Everything related to the API is in the
 link:projects/rest[`projects/rest/`] folder. This includes very standard Django
 REST Framework viewsets in link:projects/rest/views.py[`rest/views.py`],
 serializers in link:projects/rest/serializers.py[`rest/serializers.py`], and
 registering the routes from those viewsets in
 link:projects/rest/urls.py[`rest/urls.py`].

There are also some tests in the link:auth/tests.py[`auth/tests.py`] and
link:projects/tests[`projects/tests`] folders and files.

== Linting

https://github.com/psf/black[Black] is used to automatically format and lint
files. The `make lint-django` command checks that the project is correctly
formatted.

You can set up your editor to automatically format Python files using Black
following the instructions https://github.com/psf/black#editor-integration[on Black's GitHub
page].

You can also use the `make lint-django-fix` command to automatically format all
Python files in the project.

== Front-end

The front-end is a React app that's rendered through Django. This means that
Django renders a template (link:templates/app.html[`app.html`]) and inside that
template, `ReactDOM.render` is manually called (`projement.init()` calls the
`init` function in link:app/src/main.js[`app/src/main.js`]).

Read more about how the front-end works in the link:app/README.adoc[front-end
`README.adoc`].
